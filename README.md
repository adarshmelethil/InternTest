Intern Test
===

The questions are located in the `InternQuestions.java` file under `src/main/java`.

If you need to add additional methods and/or classes to solve the problem please feel free to do so.  Make sure to read the instructions for each question carefully.

Please write what you would consider good quality code and provide tests in the `InternQuestionsTest.java` file located under `src/test/java`.

Please spend no more than an hour on the problems.

In order to submit your solution, please create a GitHub project and place the code in there as we are not able to accept zip files due to email filters.  Email me a link to your GitHub project.

Good luck!
